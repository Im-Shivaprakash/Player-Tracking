The dataset includes 1271 images.
Cells are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
