# Player Tracking using YOLOv8

This project focuses on player tracking in sports videos using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, implemented in a Jupyter notebook environment. The objective is to detect and track players' movements in sports videos to analyze their gameplay and performance.

## Overview

Player tracking is a critical task in sports analytics, providing insights into player movements, interactions, and strategies during gameplay. This project utilizes YOLOv8, a popular object detection model, to detect players in sports videos and track their movements across frames.

## Key Features

- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 is used for real-time object detection, enabling the detection of players in sports videos.
- **Object Tracking**: Players detected in the video frames are tracked over time to analyze their movements and positions.
- **Visualization**: The project provides visualizations of player tracks overlaid on the video frames for easy analysis.
- **Interpretability**: The detected player tracks can be interpreted to gain insights into player behavior, team tactics, and game strategies.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed, including Python, Jupyter notebook, and the required libraries.
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the sports video dataset for player tracking analysis.
3. **Model Loading**: Load the pre-trained YOLOv8 model for player detection.
4. **Object Detection**: Run the YOLOv8 model on each frame of the video to detect players.
5. **Object Tracking**: Implement object tracking algorithms to track players across frames.
6. **Visualization**: Visualize the player tracks overlaid on the video frames for analysis.
7. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the player tracking performance and analyze the results.
